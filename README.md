# Awesome-LLM-Self-Improvement
A curated list of awesome LLM Self-improvement papers in Survey paper: A Survey on Large Language Model Self-Improvement During Inference-Time.

# Papers
Studies on LLM Self-improvement at inferece-time are categorized as follows:

## Independent Self-Improvement
*Independent Self-Improvement is achieving improvements in performance using the modelâ€™s own frozen parameters without additional training.*

### Constrained Decoding

#### Hard Constraint

 * Control-DAG: [Control-DAG: Constrained Decoding for Non-Autoregressive Directed Acyclic T5 using Weighted Finite State Automata](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-short.42) (Chen et al., NAACL 2024)

#### Soft Constraint

 * Penalty Decoding: [Penalty Decoding: Well Suppress the Self-Reinforcement Effect in Open-Ended Text Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.78) (Zhu et al., EMNLP 2023)

 * IPS (Isotropic and Proximal Search): [Fine-grained Conversational Decoding via Isotropic and Proximal Search](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.5) (Yao et al., EMNLP 2023)

 ### Contrastive Decoding

 #### Faithfulness and Hallucinations.

 #### Repetition, Coherence, and Diversity.
